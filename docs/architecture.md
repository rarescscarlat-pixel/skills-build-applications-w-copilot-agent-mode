# OctoFit Tracker architecture

OctoFit Tracker is a three-tier application for a school fitness program. The starter code includes API contracts and intentionally incomplete implementation points so you can use GitHub Copilot agent mode in a test-driven loop.

## Tier boundaries

- **Presentation tier**: React 19, Vite, React Router, Bootstrap, and a shared API client in `octofit-tracker/frontend/src`.
- **Logic tier**: Express and TypeScript routes/services in `octofit-tracker/backend/src` expose `/api/*` behavior on port `8000`.
- **Data tier**: Mongoose models and seed data in `octofit-tracker/backend/src/models` and `src/scripts/seed.ts` persist to MongoDB on port `27017`.

## Ports and environment rules

- MongoDB: `27017`
- Express API: `8000`
- Vite frontend: `5173`
- The browser calls relative `/api` paths. Vite proxies them to `http://localhost:8000`, so the unauthenticated API port stays private in Codespaces. `VITE_API_BASE_URL` can override the base URL.

## API contract

| Capability | Method and path | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity tracking | `GET /api/activities`, `POST /api/activities` | List and create valid activity records. POST accepts `userId`, `teamId`, `type`, and `minutes`; `userId` and `teamId` must be well-formed IDs for an existing user and team; otherwise respond with a deliberate 4xx (never a 500 from a cast error). A created activity stores the submitted `user`, `team`, `type`, and `minutes` plus computed `points` and `occurredAt`. |
| Teams | `GET /api/teams`, `POST /api/teams` | List and create teams with members. Created and listed teams keep the submitted `name` and `mascot`. Reject a team without a name with `400`. |
| Leaderboard | `GET /api/leaderboard` | Return teams ordered by the sum of their activity points, highest first. Each entry has `teamName`, `totalPoints`, and a 1-based `rank`. |
| Workout suggestions | `GET /api/workouts/suggestions/:userEmail` | Recommend workouts from recent activity patterns for the matching seeded user's email address. The first suggestion's `focus` matches that user's goal or recent activity, with a `reason` explaining why. An email with no matching user returns a deliberate 4xx (for example, `404`). |

## Implementation decisions

Record your plan here before editing code.

- Presentation tier decision: Keep route-level screens focused on rendering. Use the shared API client for requests and expose loading, empty, success, and accessible error states for each capability.
- Logic tier decision: Keep HTTP handling and request validation in Express routes, with business rules and database queries in the service layer. Return deliberate 4xx responses for invalid input, missing records, and malformed IDs rather than leaking database errors as 500 responses.
- Data tier decision: Use Mongoose models to enforce required fields, types, and references. Keep seed data representative of all four capabilities and preserve its idempotent behavior.
- Activity tracking approach: Accept `userId`, `teamId`, `type`, and `minutes`; validate both IDs and confirm the referenced records exist before creating an activity. Compute points in the service from the submitted activity details and set `occurredAt` when the record is created.
- Team management approach: Require a non-empty name, persist the submitted name and mascot, and store members as user references. List and create responses should expose the team fields and members expected by the API contract.
- Leaderboard approach: Aggregate activity points by team, order teams from highest total to lowest, and add a 1-based rank while shaping each result as `teamName`, `totalPoints`, and `rank`.
- Workout suggestions approach: Find the user by email, use their fitness goal and recent activity to choose relevant suggestions, and include a reason for the first suggestion. Return a deliberate 4xx response when no user matches.

## Test plan

Record the commands you run and what each failure means.

- Data-tier command: `npm run test:data --prefix octofit-tracker/backend`: verifies model validation, references, workout fields, and idempotent representative seeding. Failures indicate a data-contract or seed issue.
- API command: `npm run test:api --prefix octofit-tracker/backend`: verifies activity and team requests, leaderboard ranking, and workout recommendations over HTTP. Failures indicate route validation, service logic, response-shape, or status-code issues.
- Frontend command: `npm test --prefix octofit-tracker/frontend`: verifies API-backed rendering and loading, empty, and accessible error states across the routes. Failures indicate presentation behavior or API-client integration issues.
- Backend build command: `npm run build --prefix octofit-tracker/backend`: type-checks the backend. Failures indicate TypeScript or backend contract mismatches.
- Frontend build command: `npm run build --prefix octofit-tracker/frontend`: type-checks and bundles the frontend. Failures indicate frontend TypeScript, module, or build integration issues.
